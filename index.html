								<h2>Block Breaker</h2>
								<p>This Game was one of the first school assignments we got, i made all the assets myself except for the ball. All levels were also designed by me.</p>
								<button onclick="window.location.href = 'https://github.com/XK073/Block-Breaker.git';" class="button icon fa-download"></button>
								<p><br/> </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Block Racer.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Block Racer</h2>
								<p>This is the project i've probably had the most fun with making, i followed a tutorial by Brackeys on youtube just before my 1st schoolyear started, on how to make a game. 
								<br/>I then used this to make it into a school project and kept adding things every time i had an idea.<br/>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/gif_animation_002.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Jetroid</h2>
								<p>This Game was also a school assignment, all assets used were downloaded from an existing project. I designed one small level for this assignment.</p>
								<button onclick="window.location.href = 'https://github.com/XK073/Jetroid.git';" class="button icon fa-download"></button>
								<p><br/> </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/PongShot.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>PongShot</h2>
								<p>This Game was a project i put on the backburner, PongShot is a version of pong i came up with, in which you have to dodge instead of catch. 
									<br/>You use your arrow keys to move left and right and you shoot rockets at your opponent, rockets can cancel each other out, and if you're out of rockets you'll have to wait for it to restock.
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Enviro Game.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>EnviroGame</h2>
								<p>EnviroGame was a school project i made with a classmate at the end of our first year. In this project i made a game called FruitBarrel, in which the player must catch the right fruit with the right barrel, aside from the fruit, barrels and bowl, everything in the game FruitBarrel was made by me using unity alone.
								 <br/> In this project i put most of my focus on creating the menu's and fully animating them, which was fun to do but took alot of time and efford.
