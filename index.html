								<p>In September of 2017 I started my study at MBO Utrecht in Utrecht, 
									I've almost completed 2 years now and have one more year to go. <br/>
									In this last year I'll have to do an internship at a Game development studio and a few final exams, 
									after which I'll receive my diploma and can really start off my career.</p>

								<h2>Block Breaker</h2>
								<p>This Game was one of the first school assignments we got, I made all the assets myself except for the ball. All levels were also designed by me.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Block Racer.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Block Racer</h2>
								<p>This is the project I've probably had the most fun with making, 
									I followed a tutorial by Brackeys on YouTube just before my 1st school year started, on how to make a game. 
								<br/>I then used this to make it into a school project and kept adding things every time I had an idea.<br/>

								<span class="image main"><img src="Jetroid.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>Jetroid</h2>
								<p>This Game was also a school assignment, all assets used were downloaded from an existing project. I designed one small level for this assignment.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/PongShot.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>PongShot</h2>
								<p>This Game was a project i put on the backburner, PongShot is a version of pong i came up with, in which you have to dodge instead of catch. 
									<br/>You use your arrow keys to move left and right and you shoot rockets at your opponent, rockets can cancel each other out, and if you're out of rockets you'll have to wait for it to restock.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Enviro Game.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>EnviroGame</h2>
								<p>EnviroGame was a school project i made with a classmate at the end of our first year. In this project i made a game called FruitBarrel, in which the player must catch the right fruit with the right barrel, aside from the fruit, barrels and bowl, everything in the game FruitBarrel was made by me using unity alone.
								 <br/> In this project i put most of my focus on creating the menu's and fully animating them, which was fun to do but took alot of time and efford.

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Ik.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Iliass and this is my portfolio. It's still a work in progress, but then again so is my career.
									 In this portfolio you'll find some of the projects I made in school as assignments, but you'll also find some projects I started on my own.
									<br/>
									<br/> I am 23 years old, born and raised in 's-Hertogenbosch in the netherlands. Aside from making and playing video games, I like to ride my motorcycle, it helps me calm my mind and it energizes me.
									<br/>
									<br/> The reason I got into Game-Development was mostly because of my curiosity, i like to break things appart to see how they work and then put them back together. So when I found out what happened behind the scenes, my curiosity turned into enthusiasm and I was taken by the process of making games.
									<br/> Not long after i started watching making-offs of popular video games, I began watching tutorials on how to make your own games, and now I'm studying Game-Development and i love it.
